## Project info

Here you can find a set of basic c++ code that I used in the very beginning of my learning in this language. 

## Setup

Each .cpp file is unique and self contained. In order to compile simply use any compiler of your choice or a built-in run tool such as in VS code.

## Example:

```g++ -o example example.cpp ```

Will compile and link (in this case only 1 source file) into a "example" file that can be run by your machine.
